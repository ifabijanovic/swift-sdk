==========

## Welcome

Thanks for choosing Kinvey to build your backend.  This is your complete guide to the KinveyKit library,
KinveyKit is Kinvey's iOS library, created to make creating native iOS apps that are backed by Kinvey
incredibly easy.

## Overview

Kinvey provides a robust backend for your mobile apps by providing features that enable
you to build amazing apps without worrying about your backend.  Currently Kinvey provides
the following services:

* __appdata__ -- A query-able key/value (and more) data storage platform for your app
* __Resources__ -- A storage system for your media content (images, videos, files, etc.) that
provides out of the box Content Distribution Network (CDN) capabilities.
* __Users__ --  Keep track of users of your application and control access to data on a user-by-user basis
* __Push Notifications__ -- Our partnership with Urban Airship gives you awesome push features without the headache of managing them yourself.
* __Location-Aware Queries__ -- Query your data for entities that are near other entities.

For more details on how to use these features read the [Kinvey Service Overview](https://console.kinvey.com/#docs/kinvey/service-overview).
